                                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                                lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                                can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                                them.

                                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a
                                core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                                Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                                additional objects; for example:
                                <br><br>

                                #Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                                browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow
                                an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                                mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                                <br>
                                #Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                                running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
                                to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

                                linked on the main page about JavaScript.

                            <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
                            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
                                The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
                                type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
                                basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                                JavaScript.
                                <br>

                                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                                supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                                Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                                more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                                inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                                supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
                                properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                                <br>

                                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                                variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods
                                are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                                Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div id="variables">
                            <h1>Variables</h1>
                            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of
                                variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                                subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
                                letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
                                through "z" (lowercase).
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also
                                use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal
                                names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div id="declaring">
                            <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
                            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                                <br>
                                With the keyword var. For example,<br>
                                var x = 42.<br>
                                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>

                                By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br>
                                x = 42.<br>
                                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict <br>JavaScript warning.
                                You
                                shouldn't use this variant.<br>

                                With the keyword let. For example,<br>
                                let y = 13.<br>
                                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                                below.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div id="scope">
                            <h1>Variable scope</h1>
                            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,
                                because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a
                                variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only
                                within that function.<br><br>

                                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a
                                variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the
                                block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x
                                is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
                                this case is an if statement.<br><br>

                                if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript
                                2015.<br><br>

                                if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                                defined</p>

                        </div>
                        <div id="global">
                            <h1>Global variables</h1>
                            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global
                                object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable
                                syntax.<br><br>

                                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from
                                another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a
                                variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable
                                from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

                        </div>
