        I always wanted to work with computers and web development makes it more interesting, Especially the magic of
        programming. Solving interesting and most of the time difficult problems and creating visual objects by logic
        and patterns keeps me awake. My expectation from this boot camp is to know the way and technologies to create
        any web applications I want.
