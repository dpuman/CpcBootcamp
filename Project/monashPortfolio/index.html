                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p class="text-muted">Patrick is an expert in human-computer interaction with particular research
                    interests include the
                    application of social and ubiquitous computing, the development of new approaches to interaction
                    (including as novel sensing platforms and interaction techniques) and human-centred design methods.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">Patrick coined the term Digital Civics, now a central focus of his research.
                    Digital Civics is a
                    cross-disciplinary area of research that explores ways technology can promote new forms of
                    participation in the design and delivery of local services including education, public health and
                    social care and town planning. For example, the App Movement Platform is a new kind of technology
                    commissioing service that allows anyone to campaign for, design, and automatically generate
                    location-based review systems for topics of concern to them. </p>
                <p class="text-muted">Another key element of Patrick's work is a commitment to the creation of open
                    source software and
                    hardware. Notable examples include the OpenMovement AX3 accelerometer which was designed for the
                    largest study of physical activity ever conducted (over 100K participants) and is used by clinical
                    researchers across the World. Another is Intake24, an online 24-hour dietary recall system which was
                    developed for Food Standards Scotland. Initially aimed at a UK population, Intake24 now has Danish,
                    Portuguese, New Zealand and Arabic versions, and is used in the Scottish Health Survey.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">Before joining Monash in December 2018, Patrick was Professor of Human-Computer
                    Interaction in the
                    School of Computing, Newcastle University, United Kingdom where founded and lead Open Lab, Newcastle
                    Universityâ€™s centre for cross-disciplinary research in digital technologies. He was director of the
                    Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital
                    Civics (55 cross-disciplinary PhD students) and the EPSRC Digital Economy Research Centre a
                    multidisciplinary five-year project involving 25 postdoctoral researchers.</p>
